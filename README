= mysql2sqlite.rb

== DESCRIPTION

A Ruby script for exporting MySQL databases to Sqlite databases.


== USAGE

Can be executed by either passing the database connection values directly:

  ./mysql2sqlite.rb database_name database_user database_password

or by passing it the path to a YAML-based configuration file:

  ./mysql2sqlite.rb config.yaml


== OUTPUT

This script generates two files. The first is the raw SQL file derived from the MySQL database but after the Sqlite-specific modifications have been made to the SQL. This file is useful for debugging in the event that your MySQL database contains data that Sqlite doesn't like and this script doesn't catch (a scenario which should throw all sorts of errors to the console).

The second file is the Sqlite database itself, generated by passing the above-mentioned SQL file through sqlite3.


== YAML CONFIG FILE

If you're familiar with Rails or Merb, this format will seem uncanny:

  config:
    database: database_name
    username: database_username
    password: database_password


== OPTIONAL PARAMETERS

By default the script warns if if it is about to over-write already-existing files. However this can be explicitly configured via the following:

Command line: add "true" or "1" as the final parameter to over-write without warning:

  ./mysql2sqlite.rb database_name database_user database_password true

YAML file: add "true" as the 'overwrite' property to over-write without warning:

  config:
    database: database_name
    username: database_username
    password: database_password
    overwrite: true


== KNOWN ISSUES

I know this is version 0.2 and thus I suspect it is inefficient as all get-out and likely fails on some databases (in other words: currently, it works for me). That said, it cleanly dumps the entire Rails app I needed it to dump and the Sqlite database seems just dandy. Give it a try, let me know.


== EXPECTED FUTURE FEATURES

- The ability to specify which tables to dump and exclude all others. This feature will likely only be available when configured via the YAML file.

- Better exception handling (actually, any exception handling at all). Right now it just chokes or steamrollers when it runs into a problem (like spelling your db password incorrectly).

- The ability to exclude the intermediary SQL file via configuration (or perhaps make it opt-in).
